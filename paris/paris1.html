Proceed to the Eiffel Tower and come face to face with Paris’ biggest landmark, the Eiffel Tower. This is without doubt one of the most recognizable structures in the world. Weighing 7,000 tons, but exerting about the same pressure on the ground as an average-size person sitting in a chair, the wrought iron tower wasn’t meant to be permanent. Gustave - Alexandre, the French Engineer whose fame rested mainly on his iron bridges, built it for the 1889 Universal Exhibition. (Eiffel also designed the frame work for the Statue of Liberty).
You can climb up to the 2nd level of the tower which offers a stunning view of the city. In the evening, you take the cruise on River Seine.
Later enjoy a hot and sumptuous Indian dinner.</p>
